# Hive Simulators

Each Hive simulator maintained in the Blackfury repo is a subset of the respective Hive simulator maintained in the Hive repo. The goal internally is to maintain the minimum number of files necessary to run the Hive simulator in Blackfury.

## Usage

Since we do not maintain the whole directory, there is no way (at the moment) to run the Hive simulator directly. Instead, to run it locally, the `hive` mage namespace must be invoked.

Note: Hive requires a custom base image of polard, build this with `mage cosmos:dockerbuildhive`

### Steps
1. run `mage hive:setup` to generate the hive clone and creates the polaris namespace simulations
2. run `mage cosmos:dockerbuildhive` to build the polard base image
3. run `mage hive:test <simulation> <client>` to run the simulation on the given client

Alternatively, use `mage cosmos:testhive <simulation>` to build the base-image and run the simulation on the polard client.

Note: polaris namespace simulations are called `polaris/<name>`, for the sake of maintaining consistency with `ethereum/<name>` simulations.

## Adding simulations

Currently, the existing magefile setup only supports maintaining simulations which are forks of an existing simulation in the Hive repo.

### Dev UX
1. Add the simulation to the CI.
2. Add a new entry to the list of simulations in the `hive.go` magefile, specifying the name and which files to replace.


## .hive file extension

The `.hive` file extension used in the rpc simulation is the local replacement file for it's respective copy in the standard ethereum simulation folder.

The copy is used to make minor changes to the expected values of certain test cases to be compliant with the way that Blackfury handles returns (ex. estimateGas).

Internally, this file replaces the destination in the Hive clone generated during `mage hive:setup`.

The motivation to keeping the file in plain text is to eliminate errors generated by dependencies of the file and to remove the need to create an additional go package within Blackfury.
